	smoothly and our clients staying with us year after year.</p><br>
	<p align="justify">Our initiative began as a first-year group project at <a href="https://www.nsbm.ac.lk/">NSBM GEEN UNIVERSITY</a>, with ten enthusiastic members contributing to the platform's inception. Beyond this academic endeavor, our vision is to evolve this website into a sustainable business venture. We aspire to create an extensive database showcasing our talented and capable fellow students, allowing them to offer their services through the platform. By providing this opportunity, we aim to empower our peers and foster experiential learning in their respective fields. Moving forward, we plan to enhance the website's functionality, user experience, and security measures to ensure a supportive and thriving community for all.</p>
